Tethers the edge of the isolation membrane (IM) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediates direct lipid transfer from ER to IM for IM expansion. ATG2 binds to the ER exit site (ERES), which is the membrane source for autophagosome formation, using basic residues in its N-terminal region (NR) and to the expanding edge of the IM through its C-terminal region. The latter binding is assisted by an ATG18-PtdIns3P interaction. ATG2 then extracts phospholipids from the membrane source using its NR and transfers them to ATG9 to the IM through its predicted beta-sheet-rich structure for membrane expansion. ATG2 is also involved in the recruitment of lipids to a restricted region close to the vacuole, termed the vacuole-isolation membrane contact site (VICS), which is also essential for autophagosome formation. Necessary for the localization of ATG18 to the preautophagosomal structure (PAS) and the binding of ATG18 to ATG9. ATG2 is the most downstream ATG protein in the preautophagosomal structure organization process.

DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed.

The formation of the receptor complex composed of 2 TGFBR1 and 2 TGFBR2 molecules symmetrically bound to the cytokine dimer results in the phosphorylation and the activation of TGFRB1 by the constitutively active TGFBR2. Activated TGFBR1 phosphorylates SMAD2 which dissociates from the receptor and interacts with SMAD4. The SMAD2-SMAD4 complex is subsequently translocated to the nucleus where it modulates the transcription of the TGF-beta-regulated genes.

On CD8-positive T cell clone MC.7.G5, likely recognizes tumor-specific or -associated metabolite(s) essential for cancer cell survival, triggering killing of many cancer cell types including lung, melanoma, leukemia, colon, breast, prostate, bone and ovarian cancer cells. Mediates cancer cell cytotoxicity in an HLA-independent manner. Has no reactivity to healthy cells even stressed or infected by bacteria. Antigen recognition initiates TR-CD3 clustering on the cell surface and intracellular activation of LCK that phosphorylates the ITAM motifs of CD3G, CD3D, CD3E and CD247 enabling the recruitment of ZAP70. In turn, ZAP70 phosphorylates LAT, which recruits numerous signaling molecules to form the LAT signalosome. The LAT signalosome propagates signal branching to three major signaling pathways, the calcium, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase and the nuclear factor NF-kappa-B (NF-kB) pathways, leading to the mobilization of transcription factors that are critical for gene expression and essential for T cell differentiation into effector/memory T cells .\n  \u2022 Ig-like\n  \u2022 plasma membrane, T cell receptor complex | adaptive immune response, cell surface receptor signaling pathway\n  \u2022 Ig-like V-type, Ig-like C1-type\n  \u2022 plasma membrane, T cell receptor complex | adaptive immune response, cell surface receptor signaling pathway\n  \u2022 Ig-like\n  \u2022 plasma membrane, T cell receptor complex | adaptive immune response, cell surface receptor signaling pathway\n  \u2022 Immunoglobulin-like cell surface receptor involved in the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase-coupled signaling processes.\n  \u2022 plasma membrane, T cell receptor complex | adaptive immune response, cell surface receptor signaling pathway\n  \u2022 endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular region, plasma membrane | antigen binding, immunoglobulin receptor binding | regulation of immune response\n\n**In-Task Training Examples** (for format reference):\n  \u2022 The sequence you provided sequence has been analyzed for potential protein domains or motifs.

May be involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Essential component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones, rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is enhanced by BMI1/PCGF4. Acts as the main E3 ubiquitin ligase on histone H2A of the PRC1 complex, while RING1 may rather act as a modulator of RNF2/RING2 activity. Plays a role in the transcriptional repression of genes that are required for pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, thereby contributing to differentiation of the ectodermal and endodermal germ layers.

This leads to concentrate ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA lesions to the threshold required for recruitment of TP53BP1 and BRCA1.

Inhibits the transcriptional activity of DDIT3/CHOP and is involved in DDIT3/CHOP-dependent cell death during ER stress. May play a role in programmed neuronal cell death but does not appear to affect non-neuronal cells. Acts as a negative feedback regulator of the ATF4-dependent transcription during the ISR: while TRIB3 expression is promoted by ATF4, TRIB3 protein interacts with ATF4 and inhibits ATF4 transcription activity . Disrupts insulin signaling by binding directly to Akt kinases and blocking their activation . May bind directly to and mask the 'Thr-308' phosphorylation site in AKT1 . Interacts with the NF-kappa-B transactivator p65 RELA and inhibits its phosphorylation and thus its transcriptional activation activity.

Involved in the second phase of hydrogen peroxide generation during hypersensitive response-like cell death. Involved in the innate immune MAP kinase signaling cascade (MEKK1, MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6) downstream of bacterial flagellin receptor FLS2. Activates by phosphorylation the downstream MPK3 and MPK6. YDA-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 module regulates stomatal cell fate before the guard mother cell (GMC) is specified. This MAPK cascade also functions downstream of the ER receptor in regulating coordinated local cell proliferation, which shapes the morphology of plant organs. MKK4 and MKK5 participate in the regulation of floral organ abscission. Target of the Pseudomonas syringae type III effector HopF2, that inhibits the activation of the downstream MPK6 and PAMP-triggered immunity.

In the complex, C9orf72 and SMCR8 probably constitute the catalytic subunits that promote the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound RAB8A and RAB39B into their active GTP-bound form, thereby promoting autophagosome maturation . The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex also acts as a negative regulator of autophagy initiation by interacting with the ULK1/ATG1 kinase complex and inhibiting its protein kinase activity. As part of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, stimulates RAB8A and RAB11A GTPase activity in vitro . Acts as a regulator of mTORC1 signaling by promoting phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates .

Required for the protein trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane .\n  \u2022 Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activating Rab12. Promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound Rab12 into its active GTP-bound form. Regulates autophagy in response to starvation through Rab12 activation.

Following DNA DSBs, it is recruited to the sites of damage by ATM-phosphorylated MDC1 and catalyzes the 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, thereby promoting the formation of TP53BP1 and BRCA1 ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF). H2A ubiquitination also mediates the ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing at regions flanking DSBs in cis, a mechanism to avoid collision between transcription and repair intermediates. Also catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains, leading to degradation of substrate proteins. In addition to its function in damage signaling, also plays a role in higher-order chromatin structure by mediating extensive chromatin decondensation.\n  \u2022 Laminin EGF-like, Laminin G, Laminin N-terminal, Laminin IV type A\n  \u2022 C2H2-type\n  \u2022 GS, Protein kinase\n\n**In-Task Training Examples** (for format reference):\n  \u2022 Upon evaluating your submitted sequence, our predictive algorithms suggest the presence of: Flavoprotein, DNA/pantothenate metabolism flavoprotein C-terminal domains\n  \u2022 Using bioinformatic tools, we have identified potential protein domains or motifs within your provided sequence: Flavoprotein, DNA/pantothenate metabolism flavoprotein C-terminal domains\n  \u2022 The computational analysis of the sequence suggests the presence of the following protein domains or motifs: Flavoprotein, DNA/pantothenate metabolism flavoprotein C-terminal domains\n\n\n**Task-Specific Guidance for Domain/Motif Prediction**:\n- Identify SPECIFIC DOMAINS by name (e.g., \"SH3 domain\", \"zinc finger\", \"WD40 repeat\")\n- Describe STRUCTURAL MOTIFS (e.g., \"helix-turn-helix\", \"beta-barrel\", \"leucine zipper\")\n- Mention BINDING SITES (e.g., \"DNA-binding domain\", \"ATP-binding motif\", \"protein-protein interaction domain\")\n- Use InterPro/Pfam terminology when relevant\n- Specify domain ORGANIZATION and ARCHITECTURE\n\n\n**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS**:\n1. **Use PRECISE biological terminology** from the retrieved annotations\n2. **Prioritize high-confidence matches** - they are most similar (based on RRF fusion)\n3. **Extract domain-specific terms** (enzyme names, GO terms, motifs, etc.)\n4. **Avoid generic descriptions** - be specific\n5. **Match the terminology style** of the training examples\n6. **Be concise but technically accurate**\n\nOutput ONLY the functional description in JSON format:\n{\"description\": \"...\"}\n\nDo not include explanations, justifications, or any other text.

The first step of the pathway is the synthesis of nicotinyl-CoA from nicotinic acid by the nicotinic acid-CoA ligase pyr1. Nicotinyl-CoA is then a substrate of polyketide synthase pyr2 to produce 4-hydroxy-6-(3-pyridinyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (HPPO) which is further prenylated by the polyprenyl transferase pyr6 to yield farnesyl-HPPO. The next steps consist of an epoxidation of farnesyl-HPPO to epoxyfarnesyl-HPPO by FAD-dependent monooxygenase pyr5 and a cyclization of the terpenoid portion by the terpene cyclase pyr4 to yield deacetyl-pyripyropene E.

Tethers the edge of the isolation membrane (IM) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediates direct lipid transfer from ER to IM for IM expansion. ATG2 binds to the ER exit site (ERES), which is the membrane source for autophagosome formation, using basic residues in its N-terminal region (NR) and to the expanding edge of the IM through its C-terminal region. The latter binding is assisted by an ATG18-PtdIns3P interaction. ATG2 then extracts phospholipids from the membrane source using its NR and transfers them to ATG9 to the IM through its predicted beta-sheet-rich structure for membrane expansion. ATG2 is also involved in the recruitment of lipids to a restricted region close to the vacuole, termed the vacuole-isolation membrane contact site (VICS), which is also essential for autophagosome formation. Necessary for the localization of ATG18 to the preautophagosomal structure (PAS) and the binding of ATG18 to ATG9. ATG2 is the most downstream ATG protein in the preautophagosomal structure organization process. Involved in correct ATG9 trafficking through the preautophagosomal structure and in peroxisome degradation.

Under the current model, the protein has at least 3 conformational states: pre-fusion native state, pre-hairpin intermediate state, and post-fusion hairpin state. During fusion of viral and target intracellular membranes, the coiled coil regions (heptad repeats) assume a trimer-of-hairpins structure, positioning the fusion peptide in close proximity to the C-terminal region of the ectodomain. The formation of this structure appears to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and target cell membranes.

DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed.

H2AK119Ub gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression and participates in X chromosome inactivation of female mammals. May be involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Essential component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones, rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is enhanced by BMI1/PCGF4. Acts as the main E3 ubiquitin ligase on histone H2A of the PRC1 complex, while RING1 may rather act as a modulator of RNF2/RING2 activity.

The formation of this structure appears to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and target cell membranes. Complete fusion occurs in host cell endosomes and is dynamin-dependent, however some lipid transfer might occur at the plasma membrane. The virus undergoes clathrin-dependent internalization long before endosomal fusion, thus minimizing the surface exposure of conserved viral epitopes during fusion and reducing the efficacy of inhibitors targeting these epitopes.

Inhibits the transcriptional activity of DDIT3/CHOP and is involved in DDIT3/CHOP-dependent cell death during ER stress. May play a role in programmed neuronal cell death but does not appear to affect non-neuronal cells. Acts as a negative feedback regulator of the ATF4-dependent transcription during the ISR: while TRIB3 expression is promoted by ATF4, TRIB3 protein interacts with ATF4 and inhibits ATF4 transcription activity . Disrupts insulin signaling by binding directly to Akt kinases and blocking their activation . May bind directly to and mask the 'Thr-308' phosphorylation site in AKT1 . Interacts with the NF-kappa-B transactivator p65 RELA and inhibits its phosphorylation and thus its transcriptional activation activity. Interacts with MAPK kinases and regulates activation of MAP kinases. Can inhibit APOBEC3A editing of nuclear DNA.\n  \u2022 Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in a MAPKKK20-MKK5-MPK6 cascade involved in root growth (e.g. root cell division and elongation) and stomatal response, probably via MAPK6 activation by protein phosphorylation. Involved in the second phase of hydrogen peroxide generation during hypersensitive response-like cell death. Involved in the innate immune MAP kinase signaling cascade (MEKK1, MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6) downstream of bacterial flagellin receptor FLS2. Activates by phosphorylation the downstream MPK3 and MPK6. YDA-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 module regulates stomatal cell fate before the guard mother cell (GMC) is specified. This MAPK cascade also functions downstream of the ER receptor in regulating coordinated local cell proliferation, which shapes the morphology of plant organs. MKK4 and MKK5 participate in the regulation of floral organ abscission. Target of the Pseudomonas syringae type III effector HopF2, that inhibits the activation of the downstream MPK6 and PAMP-triggered immunity. Plays a critical role in high light stress tolerance by the mediation of the Cu/Zn SODs CSD1 and CSD2 gene expression.

In the complex, C9orf72 and SMCR8 probably constitute the catalytic subunits that promote the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound RAB8A and RAB39B into their active GTP-bound form, thereby promoting autophagosome maturation . The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex also acts as a negative regulator of autophagy initiation by interacting with the ULK1/ATG1 kinase complex and inhibiting its protein kinase activity. As part of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, stimulates RAB8A and RAB11A GTPase activity in vitro . Acts as a regulator of mTORC1 signaling by promoting phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates .

Starvation leads to ULK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-554 and Ser-572, which in turn allows recruitment of 14-3-3 adapter proteins and leads to up-regulation of GEF activity towards Rab12. Also plays a role in protein transport from recycling endosomes to lysosomes, regulating, for instance, the degradation of the transferrin receptor and of the amino acid transporter PAT4.

F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Subunits alpha and beta form the catalytic core in F(1). Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding alpha(3)beta(3) subunits leads to hydrolysis of ATP in three separate catalytic sites on the beta subunits.\n  \u2022 plasma membrane | ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis activity, ATP-dependent peptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding | protein catabolic process, proteolysis\n  \u2022 cytoplasm, vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase, V1 domain | ATP binding, proton-transporting ATPase activity, rotational mechanism | ATP metabolic process, proton transmembrane transport, vacuolar acidification\n  \u2022 ATP-dependent microtubule severing protein that specifically recognizes and cuts microtubules that are polyglutamylated.

Microtubule severing promotes reorganization of cellular microtubule arrays and the release of microtubules from the centrosome following nucleation.

Following DNA DSBs, it is recruited to the sites of damage by ATM-phosphorylated MDC1 and catalyzes the 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, thereby promoting the formation of TP53BP1 and BRCA1 ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF). H2A ubiquitination also mediates the ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing at regions flanking DSBs in cis, a mechanism to avoid collision between transcription and repair intermediates. Also catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains, leading to degradation of substrate proteins.

Nicotinyl-CoA is then a substrate of polyketide synthase pyr2 to produce 4-hydroxy-6-(3-pyridinyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (HPPO) which is further prenylated by the polyprenyl transferase pyr6 to yield farnesyl-HPPO. The next steps consist of an epoxidation of farnesyl-HPPO to epoxyfarnesyl-HPPO by FAD-dependent monooxygenase pyr5 and a cyclization of the terpenoid portion by the terpene cyclase pyr4 to yield deacetyl-pyripyropene E.

Acts as a negative regulator of mid1 distribution, excluding mid1 from non- growing ends, which prevents division-septum assembly at the cell ends. The pom1 polar gradient also mediates mitotic entry by regulating cdk1. Plays an essential role in proper localization and phosphorylation of a GAP for cdc42, rga4, which ensures bipolar localization of GTP-bound, active cdc42 involved in F-actin formation. Phosphorylates multiple other substrates that function in polarized cell growth, including tea4, mod5, pal1, the Rho GAP rga7, and the Arf GEF syt22.\n  \u2022 nucleus | DNA-binding transcription factor activity, sequence-specific DNA binding, zinc ion binding | nitrate assimilation, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II\n  \u2022 cytoplasm, cytoplasmic stress granule, P-body | mRNA binding | regulation of cell size, positive regulation of cell size, positive regulation of cell-substrate adhesion, regulation of mRNA catabolic process, invasive growth in response to glucose limitation, pseudohyphal growth, mRNA destabilization, positive regulation of translation\n  \u2022 cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granule, nuclear speck | RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding, transcription coregulator activity | cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cellular response to transforming growth factor beta stimulus, homeostasis of number of cells within a tissue, T cell receptor signaling pathway, keratinocyte differentiation, execution phase of apoptosis, defense response to Gram-negative bacterium, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II\n  \u2022 SAM\n  \u2022 nucleus | DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific, metal ion binding, RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding | negative regulation of mitochondrial fusion, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter involved in meiotic cell cycle\n\n**In-Task Training Examples** (for format reference):\n  \u2022 After analyzing the given sequence, the following protein domains or motifs are predicted: Nucleotidyl transferase domains\n  \u2022 The computational analysis of the sequence suggests the presence of the following protein domains or motifs: Nucleotidyl transferase domains\n  \u2022 Our bioinformatics tools have processed the sequence you provided sequence.

Tethers the edge of the isolation membrane (IM) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediates direct lipid transfer from ER to IM for IM expansion. ATG2 binds to the ER exit site (ERES), which is the membrane source for autophagosome formation, using basic residues in its N-terminal region (NR) and to the expanding edge of the IM through its C-terminal region. The latter binding is assisted by an ATG18-PtdIns3P interaction. ATG2 then extracts phospholipids from the membrane source using its NR and transfers them to ATG9 to the IM through its predicted beta-sheet-rich structure for membrane expansion. ATG2 is also involved in the recruitment of lipids to a restricted region close to the vacuole, termed the vacuole-isolation membrane contact site (VICS), which is also essential for autophagosome formation. Necessary for the localization of ATG18 to the preautophagosomal structure (PAS) and the binding of ATG18 to ATG9. ATG2 is the most downstream ATG protein in the preautophagosomal structure organization process.

DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed.

Acts as a sequence-specific molecular adapter, directing components of the cellular transcription machinery to the viral RNA to promote processive transcription elongation by the RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) complex, thereby increasing the level of full-length transcripts. In the absence of Tat, the RNA Pol II generates short or non-processive transcripts that terminate at approximately 60 bp from the initiation site. Tat associates with the CCNT1/cyclin-T1 component of the P-TEFb complex (CDK9 and CCNT1), which promotes RNA chain elongation. This binding increases Tat's affinity for a hairpin structure at the 5'-end of all nascent viral mRNAs referred to as the transactivation responsive RNA element (TAR RNA) and allows Tat/P-TEFb complex to bind cooperatively to TAR RNA.

H2AK119Ub gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression and participates in X chromosome inactivation of female mammals. May be involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Essential component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones, rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is enhanced by BMI1/PCGF4. Acts as the main E3 ubiquitin ligase on histone H2A of the PRC1 complex, while RING1 may rather act as a modulator of RNF2/RING2 activity. Plays a role in the transcriptional repression of genes that are required for pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, thereby contributing to differentiation of the ectodermal and endodermal germ layers. Association with the chromosomal DNA is cell-cycle dependent.

Acts with UBE2N/UBC13 to amplify the RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitination. Recruited to sites of DNA damage at double-strand breaks (DSBs) by binding to ubiquitinated histone H2A and ubiquitinates histone H2A and H2AX, leading to amplify the RNF8-dependent H2A ubiquitination and promoting the formation of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin conjugates. This leads to concentrate ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA lesions to the threshold required for recruitment of TP53BP1 and BRCA1. Catalyzes monoubiquitination of 'Lys-13' and 'Lys-15' of nucleosomal histone H2A (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively).\n  \u2022 As part of the PRC1-like complex, repress class I KNOX gene expression.

Inhibits the transcriptional activity of DDIT3/CHOP and is involved in DDIT3/CHOP-dependent cell death during ER stress. May play a role in programmed neuronal cell death but does not appear to affect non-neuronal cells. Acts as a negative feedback regulator of the ATF4-dependent transcription during the ISR: while TRIB3 expression is promoted by ATF4, TRIB3 protein interacts with ATF4 and inhibits ATF4 transcription activity . Disrupts insulin signaling by binding directly to Akt kinases and blocking their activation . May bind directly to and mask the 'Thr-308' phosphorylation site in AKT1 . Interacts with the NF-kappa-B transactivator p65 RELA and inhibits its phosphorylation and thus its transcriptional activation activity. Interacts with MAPK kinases and regulates activation of MAP kinases. Can inhibit APOBEC3A editing of nuclear DNA.\n  \u2022 Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in a MAPKKK20-MKK5-MPK6 cascade involved in root growth (e.g. root cell division and elongation) and stomatal response, probably via MAPK6 activation by protein phosphorylation. Involved in the second phase of hydrogen peroxide generation during hypersensitive response-like cell death. Involved in the innate immune MAP kinase signaling cascade (MEKK1, MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6) downstream of bacterial flagellin receptor FLS2. Activates by phosphorylation the downstream MPK3 and MPK6. YDA-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 module regulates stomatal cell fate before the guard mother cell (GMC) is specified. This MAPK cascade also functions downstream of the ER receptor in regulating coordinated local cell proliferation, which shapes the morphology of plant organs. MKK4 and MKK5 participate in the regulation of floral organ abscission.

In the complex, C9orf72 and SMCR8 probably constitute the catalytic subunits that promote the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound RAB8A and RAB39B into their active GTP-bound form, thereby promoting autophagosome maturation . The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex also acts as a negative regulator of autophagy initiation by interacting with the ULK1/ATG1 kinase complex and inhibiting its protein kinase activity. As part of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, stimulates RAB8A and RAB11A GTPase activity in vitro . Acts as a regulator of mTORC1 signaling by promoting phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates .

Starvation leads to ULK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-554 and Ser-572, which in turn allows recruitment of 14-3-3 adapter proteins and leads to up-regulation of GEF activity towards Rab12. Also plays a role in protein transport from recycling endosomes to lysosomes, regulating, for instance, the degradation of the transferrin receptor and of the amino acid transporter PAT4.

Probable substrate-specific adapter of a DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin- protein ligase complex, named CUL4A-RBX1-DDB1-DCAF1/VPRBP complex, which mediates ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins such as NF2. Involved in the turnover of methylated proteins: recognizes and binds methylated proteins via its chromo domain, leading to ubiquitination of target proteins by the RBX1-DDB1-DCAF1/VPRBP complex. The CUL4A-RBX1-DDB1-DCAF1/VPRBP complex is also involved in B- cell development: DCAF1 is recruited by RAG1 to ubiquitinate proteins, leading to limit error-prone repair during V(D)J recombination.
