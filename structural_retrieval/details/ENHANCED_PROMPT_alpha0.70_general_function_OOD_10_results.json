Serves as receptor for nuclear localization signals (NLS) in cargo substrates. Involved in the nuclear import of cdc25 and mcs1. Mediates docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) through binding to repeat-containing nucleoporins. The complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, GTP-Ran binding leads to release of the cargo. The importin is re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus ."}
